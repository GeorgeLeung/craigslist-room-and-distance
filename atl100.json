One of the bedrooms is furnished the other is not. The apt is on a Marta line.<br>\n<br>\nI'm an entrepreneur and I need an assistant. There is one young lady living with me who's also helping me out, she is 24y/o she has a job, in college, no kids and a social life , so her help is limited that's why I need another person. <br>\n<br>\nYou, be female , nonsmoker, (420 is ok) as long as it's in your room, be computer literate , I actually need you to do what you probably do anyway and that's Social Media Marketing, FB, Twitter, Instagram , etc <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis may be a deal breaker but absolutely no male visitors. I'm gone a lot and I really don't want any men sitting around my house enjoying what I've worked for. I don't care if you have your girlfriend over.<br>\n<br>\nThis is not a full-time job, it's more of help me out when I need it. This would be ideal for a college student , gay or bi female, (that way the , no men thing wouldn't be a problem) <br>\n<br>\nThe rent is 380 if you don't want to be a part-time assistant, it's $250 a month if you opt for the assistant. The apt is on a Marta line. You will have your own bathroom.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are not working then we can discuss other arrangements like being a full-time assistant/housekeeper for free rent until you get on your feet.<br>\n<br>\nI'm looking for females only. The other thing is, this is not a \"hook up \" ad, this is a serious and legit offer.<br>\n<br>\nPlease send a recent photo when you contact me, the reason is this. I've had conversations with \"women\" and come to an agreement only to find out they were men who consider themselves women ( this is Atlanta) and I've also had conversations with real women only to see them and they've got a bone going through their nose or a hundred piercings in their face. To each his own but none of the above scenarios is something I want to look at every day. I'm just trying to find a normal , stable , drama free person to help me out and share a space with, that's all.<br>\n<br>\nP.S.<br>\nIf you've seen this ad on here before and wonder why it keeps coming back up. I will tell you, it's because I'm very serious in my offer and what I keep running into is people who think I'm some feeble old man that they're going to take advantage of and when they find out that's not the case then they have a problem with moving in, or they try to change my mind about smoking cigarettes or their \"friend\" coming over. <br>\n<br>\nThe ad is straightforward, if you don't like the terms please just don't respond. I'm not changing my mind about the rules of the house. I don't need a roommate , I need an assistant, but I realize that this arrangement can benefit me and another serious person.<br>\nthank you.\n</section>", "drivingtime": 1400, "image_links": [], "time": "2016-04-18T17:05:43-0400", "latitude": 33.6919, "transittime": 4549},

Id like to find a roommate to share a very nice and newly refinished condo located near Market Village. Rent $1100 months split with half utilities. I'd say monthly expenses for the unit should run about $700 per person as I'd ideally like to keep rent under $800 monthly. Expecting to move in May but no later than June,1st. <br>\n<br>\nI can offer pictures and details of the place for rent with serious inquires. Please send me a little info about yourself and expected move date. <br>\n<br>\nAbout me, I'm a 36 y/o female with a career in veterinary medicine working 40+ hrs mostly nights. I have 2 older spayed/declawed \"dog friendly\" chill cats who don't mind keeping to smaller quarters. I'm not perfect... although, I do have ritual cleaning days, keep a tidy house, and clean up after my pets and myself if an accident should happen. During the week, I like to come home keep mostly to myself... Netflix, read, listen to music or maybe cook. I'm way past the party days although, I do enjoy nature hikes w/ my camera, good brews or glass of wine a cpl times a week and get out to concerts when time allows. <br>\n<br>\nCurrently, I share a townhouse in Smyrna w/ a friend that works daytime hours but soon to get married. I have nice bedroom and living room furnishings that I would like to use in the home if possible but welcome your style too. Therefore, seek a roommate or similar shared living situation. Where we can be respectable friends, occasionally have dinner or drinks together depending time/mood, yet polity have guests at our home. <br>\n<br>\nPlease feel free to email if you think I am a good fit to join you or you would be interested to talk more about going in on our new home. <br>\n<br>\nThanks,<br>\nStephanie <br>\n<br>\nTxt or email.\n</section>", "drivingtime": 2186, "image_links": ["http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_lpwrK1i0Mpy_600x450.jpg", "http://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_dkTCoHx6TqX_600x450.jpg"], "time": "2016-04-18T19:23:57-0400", "latitude": 33.881176, "transittime": 8048}]
